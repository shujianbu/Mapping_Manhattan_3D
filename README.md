Mapping Manhattan 3D Visualization 
====================

The main aim of the Mapping Manhattan project was to use Augmented Reality tools to bring to life, the extensive census data that exists on Manhattan. There are stories to be told, detailed information on Race, Education and Wealth to name but three, but the sheer volume of information can be overwhelming. The New York Times created a website for exploring census data through an interactive map, we felt we could go one better and introduce a third axis and new, more sophisticated interaction techniques. So our team at columbia map the data 3-Dimensionally to a 2D map of manhattan and in doing so present the data in a new and meaningful way.
